# Requirements: Synthetix Docs - AI-Augmented Technical Navigator for Bharat

## Executive Summary

An AI-powered documentation system designed to transform static technical documentation into an interactive, multilingual, context-aware learning assistant for the Indian developer ecosystem. The system addresses the critical gap between English-centric technical documentation and the linguistic preferences of Bharat's 5.5+ million developers.

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges

1. **Documentation Debt Crisis**
   - Technical debt consumes 30% of senior developer capacity
   - $700,000 annual productivity loss for 20-person teams
   - 25-35% higher developer turnover in high-debt environments

2. **Linguistic Barriers**
   - English-centric documentation excludes regional language developers
   - Regional language internet users growing at 18% CAGR
   - NEP 2020 catalyzing regional language technical education

3. **Onboarding Inefficiency**
   - Standard onboarding takes 3-4 weeks
   - 160 hours spent decoding undocumented systems
   - 74% of developers cite lack of documentation as biggest frustration

4. **Static Documentation Limitations**
   - Passive information retrieval
   - No personalization or context awareness
   - Rapid obsolescence in fast-moving protocols like Synthetix
